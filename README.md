# Database schema

Database schema is dynamically generated based on the Java Persistence API (JPA) annotations in entities.
Any change whithin the database schema can be managed by editing `persistence.xml` file
(`/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`)

```xml

<persistence-unit name="db_name">

    <class>com.biblioteca.model.entidades.Libro</class>
    <class>com.biblioteca.model.entidades.Autor</class>
    <class>com.biblioteca.model.entidades.Genero</class>
    <class>com.biblioteca.model.entidades.Usuario</class>
    <class>com.biblioteca.model.entidades.Prestamo</class>
    <properties>
        <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.driver" value="org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver"/>
        <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/db_name"/>
        <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.user" value="user"/>
        <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.password" value="password"/>
        <property name="jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="create"/>
